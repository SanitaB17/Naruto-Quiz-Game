## Design Choices

### Fonts

For user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website design, I have seamlessly integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif).

### Icons

 For the favicon, I used open soure image from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and then converted it using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).

### Colors

Colors were carefully selected from the main image to achieve a harmonious and user-friendly design using [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/).

Use of various colors will explain below.

![Colour Scheme](docs/quiz-colors.JPG)

- #23272e: This color will be used for the text color.
- #ffab63, #ff7c14: These colors will be used to create a linear gradient for the body background, harmoniously matching with the image.
- rgba(50, 50, 93, 0.25), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), rgba(10, 37, 64, 0.35): These three colors will be used for the box shadow.
- #fffff7: This color will be used for the background color of h1 and containers.
- #3b2b35: This color will be used for the border color of the buttons.
- #fff0cf: This color will be used for the background color of the buttons and the next button.
- #ffe3b2: This color will be used for the border color of the buttons.
- #14ff7c: This color will be used to indicate the correct answer.
- #ff0014: This color will be used to indicate the incorrect answer.
- #231f21: This color will be used for the border hover effect for buttons.
- #661400: This color will be used as the hover effect color for the next buttons.

### Structure

My website development will follow a mobile-first strategy, with an initial focus on smaller screens. I utilized Google Chrome DevTools to initiate styling for the Samsung Galaxy Fold, which has a width of 280px. I subsequently added breakpoints for screens with widths of 576px, 768px, and 992px.
